# Jelly UI test plan

The tests run in order. The first case creates and modifies the saved task
list; the second case starts Jelly again and verifies that the saved state is
loaded from disk.

## Test case: Create, modify, validate, and save tasks

### Aim
Verify that Jelly creates all supported task types, rejects malformed input,
marks and unmarks tasks, deletes a task, and saves the final task list.

### Input
```text
todo buy milk
deadline submit report /by 2019-12-02 1800
event team meeting /from 2019-12-02 1000 /to 2019-12-02 1100
blah
mark 1
unmark 1
delete 2
list
find milk
bye
```

### Expected output
```text
